# Excluded Folders Configuration
# Folders listed here will be excluded from "immich missing any permission" alerts
# This is useful for folders where it's intentional that immich doesn't have access

# Format: One folder name per line (case-sensitive)
# Lines starting with # are comments
# Folder names should match exactly as they appear in the database
#
# Examples:
# /Partage Cadre Gan
# /Partage Cadre Narcastet
# /My Private Folder

/Partage Cadre Gan
/Partage Cadre Narcastet
/Partage Cadre Lescar
