# Synology Photos Permission Synchronization - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a solution to align Synology Photos database permissions with filesystem ACLs for folder ID 92 ("/Scans").

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Database Analysis
- Successfully connected to the `synofoto` PostgreSQL database
- Identified folder ID 92 corresponds to "/Scans" directory
- Retrieved user permissions from the database:
  - `valentin` (UID 1026): permission 15
  - `bonzac` (UID 1033): permission 3  
  - `mathilde` (UID 1028): permission 3
  - `famille` (UID 1029): permission 3

### 2. Permission Strategy
- **Read-only approach**: All users with database permissions (>0) get read-only filesystem access
- **No write permissions**: Even users with "upload" permissions in the database only get read access on filesystem
- **Security-first**: This prevents privilege escalation while ensuring consistency

### 3. Scripts Created

#### `sync_permissions.sh`
- Main synchronization script that aligns filesystem ACLs with database permissions
- Safely handles existing ACL entries
- Only grants read-only access regardless of database permission level
- Automatically removes unauthorized users
- Preserves system deny rules for service accounts

#### `validate_permissions.sh`  
- Validation script to test that permissions are working correctly
- Tests both authorized and unauthorized users
- Verifies that write access is properly denied
- Shows current ACL status

### 4. Validation Results

✅ **All tests passed:**
- `valentin`: READ ✓, WRITE denied ✓
- `bonzac`: READ ✓, WRITE denied ✓  
- `mathilde`: READ ✓, WRITE denied ✓
- `famille`: READ ✓, WRITE denied ✓
- Unauthorized users: Access properly denied ✓

### 5. Current ACL Structure

The `/volume1/photo/Scans` folder now has:
- System deny rules for service accounts (backup, webdav_syno-j, etc.)
- Allow rule for administrators group (for admin access)
- Individual user allow rules for database-authorized users (read-only)

## Usage

### To sync permissions for folder ID 92:
```bash
cd /volume1/tools/Synology/synology-photos-shared-permissions
./sync_permissions.sh 92
```

### To validate permissions:
```bash
./validate_permissions.sh 92
```

### To extend to other folders:
```bash
./sync_permissions.sh [FOLDER_ID]
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Security**: Users can only access what they're supposed to see in Synology Photos
2. **Consistency**: Filesystem access matches database permissions
3. **Read-only safety**: No accidental writes through filesystem access
4. **Scalable**: Scripts can be applied to any shared folder by ID
5. **Maintainable**: Clear logging and validation capabilities

## Next Steps

✅ **Completed - Ready for Production Use**

The solution is now ready to be applied to other shared folders. Simply:
1. Identify the folder ID from the database
2. Run the sync script with that folder ID
3. Validate with the validation script

This maintains the principle that filesystem access should not exceed what's permitted in Synology Photos while providing a secure, read-only access model.
